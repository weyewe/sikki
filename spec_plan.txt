TODO:

1. GroupLoanWeeklyPayment 

			## create saving_entry_addition => To test payment with voluntary_savings 
	* 3  categories: 
		a. Testing the payment and the byproduct    (will be executed during weekly_task confirmation)
		b. Business logic to ensure the precondition 
		c. Update/Delete post confirmation => LATER! not now 
		

	-> For the current_week payment, the prev weekly task must be finalized 
	-> For the future week payment, the prev_weekly task can be open 
	-> If the current_week has been paid, can't double pay 
	-> if the number of future weeks is more than the number of uncleared week (can be no payment or only savinsg), error
	-> if the number of backlogs is more than unpaid backlog, will generate error
	-> no_payment/only_savings clearance will produce backlog 
	 
	
2. GroupLoanIndependentPayment


3. GroupLoanGracePeriod Payment
4. GroupLoanDefaultResolution => Standard or Custom (set at group_loan level)
